#  UPI Usage Analysis Dashboard (2021â€“2024)

This project delivers a data-driven exploration of Indiaâ€™s digital payment landscape through UPI (Unified Payments Interface) statistics. Using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, it reveals transaction behavior, adoption trends, and event-driven spikes and dips in digital payments.

##  Objective

To analyze monthly UPI transaction trends and uncover actionable insights related to consumer behavior, value growth, and seasonal payment shifts.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Selenium + BeautifulSoup)** â€“ For web scraping raw UPI data from [NPCI](https://www.npci.org.in).
- **SQL** â€“ For data cleaning, transformation, and feature creation.
- **Power BI** â€“ For building interactive dashboards with dynamic visuals and annotations.
- **Excel** â€“ For intermediate data formatting and validation.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction (Python)
- Automated web scraping pipeline using `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` to extract monthly UPI statistics directly from NPCIâ€™s website.

### 2. Data Preparation (SQL)
- Cleaned raw data and structured it for analysis.
- Created new columns:
  - `Month_Year` and `MonthNumber` (for accurate sorting)
  - `Average Ticket Size` = Value Ã· Volume
  - `MoM Growth %` for both **Volume** and **Value**

### 3. Dashboarding (Power BI)
- Built **dual-axis combo charts** for Value and Volume trends.
- Added **chart annotations** for significant economic/tech events (like RBI guidelines, UPI Lite launches, festive surges).
- Visualized:
  - Monthly growth
  - Quarterly performance
  - Drop-off anomalies
  - Seasonal usage trends
  - 
##  Key Insights

- **â‚¹98.3T+ total value** transacted across **60.8M+ UPI transactions**
- â¬‡ **Average Ticket Size** consistently declined, highlighting widespread micro-payments and increased usage for small purchases
- Major spikes observed during festive seasons (Diwali, year-end bonuses)
- Notable dips (e.g., Feb 2023) explained via less days and budget effect
- Huge decline in Nov 2024 despite UPI Lite upgrades. They didnâ€™t instantly reflect in transaction valueâ€”indicating phased adoption or smaller value caps. 


## Notable Features

- Automated data sourcing (Python scraping)
- Dual-axis trend visualization (Volume + Value)
- Interactive tooltips with real-world event explanations
- MoM growth logic built using DAX in Power BI
- Comparative views for quarters and years

## Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time API-based data updates
- Extend to include bank-wise or region-wise trends
- Forecast future UPI growth using time series modeling
